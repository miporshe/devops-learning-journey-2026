🚀 Day 1: Infrastructure Setup
📅 Date: 11 January 2026
🎯 What I Actually Did
Tried VirtualBox + Ubuntu Desktop - laptop couldn't handle it

Switched to WSL2 - worked perfectly

Installed Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

Got my first Linux terminal working

💡 Key Learnings
Choose tools that fit your hardware - WSL2 was the right choice for my laptop

Simple solutions can be professional - WSL2 is used by Microsoft engineers


📚 Commands I Used
bash
pwd     # Where am I?
ls      # What's here?
cd ~    # Go home
whoami  # Check user
uname -a # System info
🛠️ Setup Process
powershell
# Windows PowerShell (Admin)
wsl --install -d Ubuntu

📝 Note to Self
Starting DevOps isn't about perfect tools, it's about finding solutions that work. My laptop + WSL2 = perfect match.
